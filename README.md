# hello-world
First repository for tests of Git's functionality

Trying to get familiar with Git. 

Main goal is to have one place to store the various code and have instant acess to it. So I don't have some files here and some files there in different states.
Second one is to gain experience with it.

Hope I'll manage to do that.
